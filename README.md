# ts-rollback

This is a (barely) working port of GGPO style netcode for realtime games, especially fighting games.

The [demo](https://ts-rollback.vercel.app/) source is [here](./client/src/rollback/example).

The main objective of this was just to learn about this style of networking.

These were the most valuable resources I found while researching:

### Articles
https://ki.infil.net/w02-netcode.html absolutely incredible in-depth article on rollback.

### Videos
[EVO 2017: GGPO PANEL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9JTIn1SVQ4): Explanation by the original author of GGPO, Tony Cannon. Goes into the original motivations behind GGPO and why it was so well received.

[8 Frames in 16ms: Rollback Networking in Mortal Kombat and Injustice 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jb0FOcImdg): Especially liked the comparison with lockstep on this one.
